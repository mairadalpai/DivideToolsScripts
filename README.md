# DivideToolsScripts

This repository is a set of scripts that I used to run the across divide of [DivideTools](https://github.com/amforte/DivideTools).

The AlongDividePlot.m is a modification of the AlongDividePlot.m from [DivideTools](https://github.com/amforte/DivideTools) to plot the deltas of Elevation, Relief, Gradient, and X. The deltas were standardized. I have made these modification to adapt to my use.
